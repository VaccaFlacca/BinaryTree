# Participants: Cody Vacca (vaccaflacca), James Szabo (Jamesszabo), Evan Wilken (EvanWilken), Raleigh Dial (Mediocrecode)
# This program is a binary search tree that runs through a tree of integers and prints them in order, pre-order, and post-order.
# It will also search the tree for specific integers and will print the integer if it is found, along with the number of elements in the tree and the tree height.
# The script will test 3 different files (with different sets of integers), and will see if error messages display when the command line argument is wrong or if the the input file doesn't exist.
